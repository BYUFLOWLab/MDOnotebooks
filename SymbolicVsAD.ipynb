Of course in an optimization we would need to evaluate the gradient way more than 10 times, but I don't want to wait that long. We will just evaluate at the same point all 10 times because it doesn't really matter. Notice I'm not even timing the time it takes to generate the expression, we are assuming that is free.  "
