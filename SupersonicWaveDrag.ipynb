    "# Drag Minimization of a Supersonic Body of Revolution Using Surrogate-Based Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we want to find the three-dimensional shape with the lowest supersonic wave drag for a fixed length and fixed maximum diameter.  This problem has a known solution called the [Sears-Haack body](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears–Haack_body) (see below).  This solution is useful, for example, in supersonic aircraft design.  The goal is to design the aircraft with area distributions close to that of the Sears-Haack body.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"supersonic/Sears-Haack.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we assume that the solution is unknown, and use surrogate-based optimization to find the best design we can.  We parameterize the body of revolution as shown below, with six radii to optimize (the body has fore-aft symmetry, and the aft half is not shown). Points are clustered towards the nose where the shape changes rapidly.  The interior 6 points are bookended by a point at the nose with 0 radius so that the body is closed, and a point with a fixed radius of 5 so that the diameter of the body is constant (all dimensions are unitless in this problem).  An Akima spline is fit between the 8 points to define the full shape.  The length of the body is 100.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"supersonic/searshaack.pdf\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "My colleague Dev Rajnarayan has provided the code that will be used to analyze the wave drag of the supersonic body as a function of the six radii.  You will not have access to the source code, and the output has some \"discretization noise\", both of which simulate common real-life scenarios.  Think of this code as a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation.  CFD is typically very timing consuming to run (the code in this exercise is quick) and unless you have access to the source to add analytic gradients, or gradients are already provided, then optimizing with CFD in the loop is usually too costly.  Because of a limited time budget we want to find a good solution with as few function calls as possible.  We may also want to explore variations in our design after finding the optimal solution.  These requirements make the problem a good candidate for a surrogate model.  We will construct a global polynomial surrogate model of the simulation and will optimize the surrogate rather than the actual function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following write-up will guide you through the steps of the analysis, but you'll need to fill in some of the  details yourself.  This guide uses Matlab because the external code is written in Java and it's easier to interface with for this one-off analysis.\n",

    "The resulting point will probably not be particularly accurate.  This is because we used an extremely small number of samples (20) to construct our initial surrogate in a 6-dimensional space, so we can't hope for high accuracy everywhere except near the sample points.  One strategy to improve this, is to sample more points initially to create a better global model.  This would be a good approach if wanted to explore global changes to the designs.  However, in this case we don't necessarily care about having an accurate model everywhere, but instead care about having an accurate model near the optimum.  We intentionally kept the initial sampling small because we are going to add our \"optimum\" solution to our sample, recreate the surrogate with the new point added, and then reoptimize using the new surrogate.  This should improve our surrogate near the actual optimum, and if we iterate a few times we should get a pretty good solution.  (Note: If we are not careful we could add points to our surrogate that are really close to points that our already there, which can cause numerical issues with our least squares solutions---but we won't worry about that in this example.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we also know exactly how far our surrogate is off by evaluating the actual function at the point in question.  Let's run our optimization until the optimal point has a predicted drag coefficient within 5% (arbitrarily chosen) of the actual drag coefficient.  We will see that even though the difference between our predicted function value $\\hat{f}(\\hat{x}^*)$ and the actual function value $f(\\hat{x}^*)$ may be off by as much as 5%, the difference between the actual function value $f(\\hat{x}^*)$ and the actual optimum $f^* = f(x^*)$ (which is what we actually care about) is smaller---usually less than 1%.  In addition to our error stopping criteria, we will limit the loop to 20 function calls at the most (generally the loop breaks after about 10).  "
